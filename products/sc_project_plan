Gather information about what is in blue bins
Design physical setup along with any changes
Design page components, specific pages, folders, etc: index.html, .css, pics and products folders
Draw a wireframe
Build html skeleton and basic CSS
After page is up and basically running get the CSS layout done in box, flex and grid
Get it into git with forks for each of the CSS layouts, while I am thinking about how to manage this in git maybe have alternate pages for each: sc_boxes_bx, sc_boxes_fx, sc_boxes_gr; gritty but effective for now
Start to add the CSS style touches
Incorporate javaScript
Is there a Python need here?
